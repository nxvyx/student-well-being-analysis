# Student Well-Being Analysis Project Readme

# Project Overview
Welcome to the Student Well-Being Analysis Project. This project focuses on using probability and statistics in Python to analyze the well-being of students in an educational context. The project aims to understand the factors affecting student well-being, with a particular focus on the relationship between well-being and academic performance. 

# Project Files
- *Main Jupyter Notebook*: The primary file where the analysis is conducted. It covers data collection, preprocessing, analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling.

- *Data Files*: Dataset(s) used for the analysis. Ensure these are included or properly referenced.

- *Readme File*: You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project.

# Project Steps

1. *Data Collection*: Begin with gathering well-being data, including stress levels, mental health, and academic performance. Ensure data is properly structured and documented.

2. *Data Preprocessing*: Clean, normalize, and handle missing data in the dataset. This step is crucial for accurate analysis.

3. *Descriptive Statistics*: Calculate basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand the dataset.

4. *Probability Distributions*: Apply probability distributions (e.g., normal, binomial) to model student well-being data.

5. *Hypothesis Testing*: Conduct statistical tests to assess relationships and differences among various student groups.

6. *Correlation Analysis*: Analyze correlations between well-being factors (e.g., stress levels, mental health, and academic performance).

7. *Data Visualization*: Create visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to illustrate key findings and trends.

8. *Predictive Modeling*: Develop regression models to predict future well-being based on historical data. This allows for early intervention.

9. *Insights and Recommendations*: Summarize key findings, draw conclusions, and provide recommendations for enhancing student well-being.
